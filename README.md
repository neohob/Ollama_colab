# Ollama run on Google colab

This program can run Ollama on Google Colab, which enables free use of Colab's GPU. Running locally via port mapping is also possible. It's as convenient as using a local Ollama with a GPU, except that there's a runtime limit of 12 hours per day for the free Colab GPU.
